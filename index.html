      <img src="assets/images/amberrunge.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">
      <p>My name is Amber and I am ambitious up and coming web developer. I am in the process of completing a coding boot camp at George Washington University. My degree is in Hospitality, but I decided to change my focus to web development to better my future and secure my long-term job goal. After being in the work force I have enhanced my skills in time-management, communication, organization, working in fast paced and high-pressure environments, and working in teams.  I am ready and willing to learn anything that comes my way with in the coding world and the job I am in. I am willing to take on leadership roles within companies to help better the people working with me and myself. My end goal to would be to work for the Walt Disney Company. I can accomplish this goal by being an asset in the rapidly increasing job field of web development.
